# Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This Python script performs car price prediction using linear regression. It involves data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using a dataset sourced from Quikr. The script utilizes libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd your_repository
   ```
3. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have the dataset named `quikr_car.csv` in the project directory.
2. Run the Python script `car_price_prediction.py`.
3. The script will perform data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
4. After execution, you will find the trained model saved as `LinearRegressionModel.pkl` in the project directory.

## Dataset
- The dataset (`quikr_car.csv`) contains information about used cars listed on Quikr, including features like car name, company, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, and price.

## Files
- `car_price_prediction.py`: Main Python script containing the code for car price prediction.
- `quikr_car.csv`: Dataset file containing the car listings data.
- `LinearRegressionModel.pkl`: Saved trained model file.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
